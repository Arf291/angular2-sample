# Angular 2 Sample

This repository includes Angular 2 example apps, aiming to get introduce to this new technology. At the beginning, it will contain Angular 2 basic tutorial apps taken from the official documentation.

## [Angular 2 quick start](/quick-start)

This is a really simple example app taken from the [Angular 2 - 5 Min QuickStart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html).

## Tour of Heroes

Angular official [Tutorial: Tour of heroes](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/) teaches the core fundamentals of building an Angular 2 app, in this case for a super heroes agency. 

This is a really good example to get started in this technology and get familiar with its structure.

Note: I have made a little modification in the app folder structure, where I have separated all the different components and it stuff in their own folders.
